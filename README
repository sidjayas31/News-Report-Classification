This README file corresponds to the final_classifier.py script.

Run the "final_classifier.py" file, this file will import the other files for usage.

1. The program loads the training and test data from the scikit learn python module.

2. Then the feature extraction is done using TFIDF process.

3. Then based on this both Bernoulli and Multinomial classifiers are built.

4. Next, the model is tested on test data sample.

5. Then evaluate the performance using precision, recall and F-1 measure.

6. Performance of Bernoulli and Multinomial models are compared.
